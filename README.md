# Strassens Algorithm

###### This	program	contains implementation of	Strassen's	method	for	multiplying	two	square	matrices	with	divide	and	conquer	and	recursion.

## Input
The	first	line	contains	an	integer	
M specifying	how	many	datasets	are	in	the	file.		The	reminder	of	the	file	encodes	the	datasets.	Each	dataset	
starts	with	an	integer	N that	is	a	power	of	2	specifying	the	size	of	the	2	input	matrices	(i.e.	N	by	N).	The	following	
2 lines	each	contain	the entries	of	the	two	input	matrices	(N>0).		Each	matrix	is	encoded	in	one	line	as	a	space	
separated	sequence	of	N^2 floating	point	numbers,	enumerate	row	by	row.

Here	is	an	example:
```

1	2	3	4
9	8	7	6
